  <summary>1.2.2 | 03.01.2024</summary>

1.2.2 brings ESLint Stylistic Plugin into your life. This will make your work with the project even more enjoyable.

Remember, Relivator is designed to be beginner-friendly, so quite a lot of ESLint options are turned off, just turn on what you need.

These turn-offs will be gradually eliminated as we move towards the massive 2.0.0, which will significantly raise the project's standards, being professional, will be even more convenient for beginners.

  <summary>1.2.1 | 02.01.2024</summary>

This is quite a small update compared to all the past ones, but this one also deserves your attention. Now, updates will generally be smaller but will appear more frequently. Thanks to this, it will be possible to easily update forks and independent projects that use Relivator as their base.

Update v1.2.1 adds Chinese localization, and among other things, work has begun on the so-called token system, which will allow future versions to work with Figma design systems in an automated way. It will also help to make the styles in the project cleaner by significantly reducing the number of Tailwind classes. For this, Relivator now installs the wonderful package @tokenami, developed by @jjenzz; Jenna, thank you so much for this library!

p.s. 1.2.1 is the first commit to the Relivator repository that no longer contains an emoji at the beginning of its name. Thanks to this, contributors to Relivator/Reliverse will no longer have to spend time inventing a suitable emoji.

  <summary>1.2.0 | [27.12.2023] üéÑ Relivator v1.2.0 is here! ü•≥ Click to see the announcement üéÅ</summary>

_Relivator 1.2.0 is already here! I, [@blefnk Nazarii Korniienko](https://github.com/blefnk), am thrilled to wrap up this year 2023, proudly presenting this release to the OSS community! So, the result of over two months of hard work is finally here!_

In this version, significant attention was focused on stability, security, performance optimization, and a substantial improvements in design‚Äîboth visually, UX, and the logic of how the app works. A lot was really done, too much to list everything! Be sure to install it and check it out for yourself!

By the way, you can now enjoy a finely-tuned ESLint Flat Config! Also, it's worth noting that Clerk, since version 1.1.0, is no longer considered deprecated in the Relivator project. Thanks to 1.2.0, Clerk now works seamlessly with an easy switch to NextAuth.js when needed, all on the fly. Plus, full support for Turbopack (next dev --turbo) is finally here, even for next-intl!

As for next-intl, finally, we can now enjoy internationalization that works not only on the client-side but also on the server! Only the 404 page has client-side i18n messages, all other pages and components use i18n as server-first. And this is really cool!

Many unique solutions have been implemented in this new version. Moreover, using Relivator from this version, you have the opportunity to try out the alpha version of our unique Code-First/No-Code Builder system for React pages and components (which will appear in Reliverse CMS in the future). Just visit the Admin page while in the development environment and enjoy.

If you have already used Relivator before, please pay attention, this is very important! Be sure to check the updated .env.example file and update your .env file accordingly.

As a small teaser/spoiler, for Relivator 1.3.0, even more improvements in visual design and UX are planned; 1.4.0 will come with a magical CLI implementation, allowing you to quickly obtain only the necessary features and dependencies for your app (even automated updates and the ability to add other functions and packages to an already installed app); 1.5.0 will undergo a full code refactoring that will meet all the best standards and practices; 1.6.0-2.0.0+ versions, apart from many other things, will receive most of the items currently unchecked in the Roadmap (located in the project's README.md). It's going to be incredible!

So, install this new version of Relivator 1.2.0 and appreciate the multitude of incredible features, and freely use it in your own projects today. Please use your preferred feedback channels to share your thoughts on Relivator 1.2.0 and what you would like to see in future releases.

Don't forget to also check out the significantly updated README.md, it's worth it.

Enjoy! ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è Merry Christmas and Happy New Year 2024! üéáü•≥
