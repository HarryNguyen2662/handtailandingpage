The development could be significantly accelerated by hiring additional developers. Therefore, I, @blefnk Nazarii Korniienko, would be immensely grateful to anyone who could donate to the project in any amount. Please refer to the repository page to see Patreon and other platforms as well. A big thank you to everyone in advance!"
